  // ---------- Season ----------
  ['playing', 'Season', 'Playing and simming games', 'play week sim season replay box score watch',
   `<p><b>&gt; PLAY WEEK</b> plays one week for the whole league. <b>»» SIM TO PLAYOFFS</b> plays every remaining week but still stops for scouting check-ins.</p>
   <p>Every play is simulated. Open any played game from the Schedule tab for its box score, scoring summary and (for your games) a play-by-play replay.</p>`],
  ['standings', 'Season', 'Standings, tiebreakers and playoff seeding', 'standings seeding playoffs wild card bye division conference tiebreaker',
   `<p>There are two conferences (American and National), each with four divisions (North, South, East, West).</p>
   <p>Each conference sends 7 teams: the 4 division winners (seeds 1-4, by record) and 3 wild cards (seeds 5-7). The <b>1 seed gets a bye</b> through the Wild Card round. Higher seeds host. Ties are broken by head-to-head, division record, conference record, then point differential.</p>`],
  ['schedule', 'Season', 'How the schedule is made', 'schedule opponents strength next year rotation',
   `<p>Each team plays its division twice, one full division from its own conference and one from the other (rotating each year), plus extra games against teams that finished in the <b>same place</b> in their divisions last year. A good season means a tougher schedule next year.</p>`],
  ['awards', 'Season', 'Awards and honors', 'awards mvp opoy dpoy rookie all-pro hall of fame',
   `<p>Awards are announced after Week 18, before the playoffs: MVP, Offensive and Defensive Player of the Year, Offensive and Defensive Rookie of the Year, and All-Pro teams. The Megacup also crowns an MVP. Great careers can end in the Hall of Fame (History tab).</p>`],
  ['injuries', 'Season', 'Injuries, illness and IR', 'injury injured hurt illness sick ir injured reserve return fill-in',
   `<p>Players can get hurt in games or fall ill during the week. Each injury has a set number of weeks. Anything 4 weeks or longer moves the player to <b>IR</b>, which frees his active-roster spot.</p>
   <p>Serious injuries (torn ACL or Achilles, for example) can permanently cost speed or agility. Hurt players are skipped on game day; if a position runs dry, a player from a similar position fills in.</p>
   <p>With <b>Auto-manage injuries</b> on, your staff signs fill-in free agents when you're short and trims the roster when players return. Turn it off to do it yourself.</p>`],
  ['depth', 'Season', 'Depth chart', 'depth chart starters lineup order bench who starts',
   `<p>The DEPTH tab shows every position in order. Use the arrows (top / up / down) to change it at any time. Starters are highlighted.</p>
   <p>Positions you never touch stay on <b>AUTO</b> (best OVR starts). Once you change one it's <b>MANUAL</b>; new arrivals slot in by OVR. Press <b>AUTO</b> on a position, or <b>RESET ALL TO AUTO</b>, to undo. Injured players are skipped automatically.</p>`],
  ['training', 'Season', 'Weekly focus training', 'training practice improve develop focus slots auto',
   `<p>Each week after your game, up to 3 players get focus training. Pick a player and either one rating or <b>Balanced</b>. Gains build up over weeks and add rating points.</p>
   <p>Young players with lots of room below their potential grow fastest (GROWTH: HIGH). Veterans past their peak barely move. Any slot left on <b>AUTO</b>, or whose player is hurt, is filled by your staff's best pick, so you never have to touch it. AI teams train too.</p>`],
  ['news', 'Season', 'News and storylines', 'news stories storylines headlines rivalry record chase',
   `<p>The NEWS tab collects storylines: records broken or under threat, milestones, players returning from injury, streaks, rivalry games, big signings and trades. Filter by type at the top.</p>`],

  // ---------- Players ----------
  ['ratings', 'Players', 'Ratings, OVR and potential', 'ovr overall potential pot grade ratings attributes rating colors',
   `<p>Every player has 17 ratings (speed, strength, throw accuracy, coverage...). <b>OVR</b> is a weighted mix of the ratings that matter for his position. <b>POT</b> is his likely ceiling, shown as a grade from F to A+.</p>
   <p>Players improve toward their potential while young, peak in their mid-to-late 20s (QBs and kickers later), then decline. Breakouts and bad offseasons happen.</p>`],
  ['generational', 'Players', 'Generational "S" talents', 's potential generational rare superstar elite prospect',
   `<p>About one draft class in three has a <b>generational</b> prospect with an <span class="pot pot-s">S</span> potential grade. They come into the league around 80-86 OVR, peak for longer, decline at half the normal rate and play well into their 30s. Everyone knows who they are; they're usually gone in the first few picks.</p>`],
  ['editor', 'Players', 'Editing players', 'edit player change ratings name bio cheat customize',
   `<p>Open any player's card and press <b>EDIT PLAYER</b> to change his ratings, potential, name, college, position, number, age, height, weight or injury length. OVR recalculates when you save.</p>`],

  // ---------- Contracts & cap ----------
  ['cap', 'Contracts & cap', 'The salary cap', 'salary cap payroll space over the cap money budget',
   `<p>The cap starts at <b>$220M</b> and rises every year (usually 3-10%) as league payrolls rise. Your payroll is every active contract plus dead money.</p>
   <p>You can't start a season over the cap. If you are, release or trade players. Check the CONTRACTS tab for your space, future commitments and every team's payroll.</p>`],
  ['negotiate', 'Contracts & cap', 'Negotiating a contract', 'negotiate offer contract asking salary years accept reject chance odds',
   `<p>Click <b>NEGOTIATE</b>, <b>RE-SIGN</b>, <b>EXTEND</b> or <b>RESTRUCTURE</b> next to a player. Set a salary and length and press <b>MAKE OFFER</b>.</p>
   <p>The window shows <b>CHANCE HE SAYS YES</b>, updated as you type. Salary matters most, then length. Lowballs make him dig in, and <b>after 4 failed offers he stops talking</b>.</p>
   <p>Presets: <b>Budget</b> (cheapest plausible, risky), <b>Team friendly</b> (length that favors you: long deals for rising young players, 1 year for declining vets) and <b>Player friendly</b> (what he asked for, almost always accepted).</p>`],
  ['vets', 'Contracts & cap', 'Veterans and 1-year deals', 'veteran old declining one year prove it short deal age',
   `<p>Players past their peak, or whose OVR dropped last year, are marked <b>declining</b>. They want shorter deals and will take a <b>1-year prove-it deal</b> for noticeably less. Young improving players are the opposite: they want long deals and resist short ones.</p>`],
  ['resign', 'Contracts & cap', 'Re-signing and staff negotiations', 're-sign resign expiring sim negotiations staff auto let go plan',
   `<p>In the offseason's re-signing phase, the CONTRACTS tab lists everyone whose deal expired. Anyone you don't re-sign hits free agency.</p>
   <p>Only care about a few? Negotiate those yourself, then use the <b>PLAN</b> column (AUTO / RE-SIGN / LET GO), choose a staff approach and press <b>SIM NEGOTIATIONS</b>. AUTO lets your staff decide who's worth keeping. You get a report of every result. The same tools work for final-year extensions during the season.</p>`],
  ['extend', 'Contracts & cap', 'Extensions and restructures', 'extension extend restructure early bargain rookie deal lock up',
   `<p><b>Extend</b>: during the preseason or season, players in the last year of their deal can sign an extension that starts next year.</p>
   <p><b>Restructure</b>: players paid well under market with years left (often rookies who became starters) appear under <b>RESTRUCTURE CANDIDATES</b>. A restructure replaces the current deal with a new one starting now and running past the old end year. The player takes a discount for getting paid early, bigger the more cheap years he had left. One per player per season.</p>`],
  ['cuts', 'Contracts & cap', 'Releasing players and dead money', 'cut release dead money waive roster 53 staff cut review',
   `<p>Releasing a player under contract leaves <b>50% of this year's salary and 25% of next year's</b> on your cap as dead money. Rookies and minimum deals are cheap to cut.</p>
   <p><b>STAFF CUT REVIEW</b> (Roster and Contracts tabs) lists surplus depth and overpaid backups with the cap each cut saves. <b>AUTO-CUT TO 53</b> trims your weakest extra players.</p>`],
  ['roster', 'Contracts & cap', 'Roster limits', 'roster limit 53 active minimum full spots ir',
   `<p>You can carry <b>53 active players</b> (IR doesn't count). You need 53 or fewer and to be under the cap to start a season. If you're short, sign free agents or press <b>AUTO-FILL ROSTER</b>.</p>`],

  // ---------- Offseason ----------
  ['fa', 'Offseason', 'Free agency', 'free agency free agents waves sign bidding market',
   `<p>Free agency runs in <b>3 waves</b>. Before and between waves you can negotiate with anyone on the FREE AGENTS tab. Each wave, AI teams sign players. Top names get bid up early; whoever is left gets cheaper each wave.</p>
   <p>Press <b>FINISH FREE AGENCY</b> to sim the rest. You'll get a <b>free agency review</b>: who you signed, who left and where, your team rating change and a grade. Free agents are also available during the season at a discount.</p>`],
  ['scouting', 'Offseason', 'Scouting', 'scouting scout points prospects fog unscouted basic detailed full combine',
   `<p>Prospects' ratings are hidden behind scouting fog. Unscouted, the OVR shown can be off by about 9. Spend points to scout a prospect: <b>Basic</b> (1 pt, about ±5), <b>Detailed</b> (2 more pts, about ±2.5 and shows ratings) and <b>Full</b> (3 more pts, exact).</p>
   <p>Points come from check-ins during the season and a big batch at the <b>Scouting Combine</b>, which also posts 40-yard, bench and vertical results. <b>AUTO-SCOUT</b> spends your points on prospects that fit your needs. Prospects rise and fall during their college season.</p>`],
  ['traits', 'Offseason', 'College reports (traits)', 'traits college report strengths weaknesses scouting notes',
   `<p>Each prospect has 3-5 traits like "Breakaway speed on routes" (+ speed, agility, route running) or "Drops catchable balls" (- catching). They're tied to his real ratings. You see 2 unscouted, and one more per scouting level.</p>`],
  ['draft', 'Offseason', 'The draft and pick grades', 'draft pick grade true rank value steal reach review on the clock recommended',
   `<p>The draft is 7 rounds, ordered worst record to best (playoff teams last). When you're on the clock, pick from <b>RECOMMENDED PICKS</b> (your board blended with team needs) or the big board. Use <b>SIM TO MY PICK</b> to skip ahead.</p>
   <p>Every pick is graded: <b>picked</b> slot vs. <b>true</b> rank, where the player really ranks in the class by real ratings and position value. Taking the class's 5th-best player at #12 is +7 and a good grade. After the draft you get a <b>draft review</b> with your class grade, steals, reaches and every team's grade.</p>`],
  ['needs', 'Offseason', 'Team needs', 'needs need high med low position weakness',
   `<p>The draft and trade screens rate each position's need (HIGH / MED / LOW) from your starters vs. the league average, depth, aging starters, long injuries and young successors already on the roster.</p>`],
  ['rookies', 'Offseason', 'Rookie contracts', 'rookie contract slot salary 4 year',
   `<p>Draft picks sign 4-year rookie deals priced by draft slot; the top picks cost the most. Great rookies on cheap deals are prime restructure candidates later.</p>`],

  // ---------- Trades ----------
  ['trades', 'Trades', 'Making trades', 'trade trading propose offer balance players picks deadline',
   `<p>On the TRADE tab, choose a partner, then click assets on both sides: players and future draft picks. Press <b>WHAT WOULD IT TAKE?</b> to have the other team add what they'd want from you, or <b>PROPOSE TRADE</b> to send it.</p>
   <p>AI teams value players by talent, age, need, contract and cap fit. The trade deadline is after <b>week 9</b>; trading reopens after the Megacup.</p>`],
  ['picks', 'Trades', 'Draft pick value', 'pick value elite high mid low tier projected order',
   `<p>Future picks are valued by where the team is <b>projected</b> to pick, from current strength and record. Tiers: <b>ELITE</b> (top 5), <b>HIGH</b> (6-12), <b>MID</b> (13-22) and <b>LOW</b>. A bad team's first-rounder is worth a lot more than a contender's.</p>`],

  ['offers', 'Trades', 'Trade offers from other teams', 'trade offer offers deadline draft day trade up accept decline counter',
   `<p>Other teams will sometimes call you with offers: in the weeks before the trade deadline (week ${TRADE_DEADLINE_WEEK}), and when you're on the clock in the draft, usually a team trying to move up. An offer can be picks, players or a mix.</p>
   <p>Offers pop up when they arrive, and the <b>⇄ OFFERS</b> button in the header keeps them handy. <b>ACCEPT</b>, <b>DECLINE</b>, or <b>COUNTER IN TRADE TAB</b> to load the deal into the trade screen and adjust it. Deadline offers stay open for about two weeks, and draft offers expire once you make the pick. SIM TO PLAYOFFS pauses when an offer comes in.</p>`],
  ['simscout', 'Season', 'Simming ahead and auto-scouting', 'sim ahead skip scouting auto scout check-in needs projected pick',
   `<p>If you press <b>SIM TO PLAYOFFS</b>, scouting check-ins don't stop the sim. Your scouts spend the points themselves, focusing on prospects at positions you need who are likely to still be there at your projected picks. When a check-in is open, <b>AUTO-SCOUT &amp; SIM TO PLAYOFFS</b> does the same thing.</p>
   <p>The Scouting tab's <b>NEEDS AT YOUR PICKS</b> panel shows your projected picks and how each need looks from there: ▲ a good fit is likely to be available, ▼ nothing worth taking is projected.</p>`],
  ['morale', 'Players', 'Player morale (beta)', 'morale happiness mood happy frustrated locker room boost penalty ratings',
   `<p>Every player has a <b>morale</b> score (0-100, about 60 is normal). It shows on the roster (sort by MORALE), on each player card, and as team morale on the Home tab.</p>
   <p>It goes up with wins (especially big ones and streaks) and down with losses, injuries (a star going down hurts the whole locker room), being traded, and how you handle off-field events: suspending or fining a player stings him, backing him or supporting his charity lifts him. It drifts back toward normal each week and resets halfway in the offseason.</p>
   <p>In games, morale shifts all of a player's ratings: +1 to +3 when he's happy or fired up, -1 to -3 when he's frustrated or miserable.</p>`],
  ['ops', 'Season', 'Operations: fans, stadium, prices (beta)', 'operations fans fan happiness stadium upgrade maintenance prices tickets season tickets food concessions jerseys merchandise events arrest sewage cash',
   `<p>The <b>OPERATIONS β</b> tab runs the business side. Operations cash is separate from the salary cap.</p>
   <p><b>Fan happiness</b> (0-100) rises with wins and good game days, and falls with losses, high prices, a run-down stadium and bad decisions. Happy fans buy more season tickets, single-game tickets, food and jerseys, and give you a louder home crowd on the field.</p>
   <p><b>Pricing:</b> set season tickets (sold when the season starts), single-game tickets, concessions and jerseys. The tab shows a "fair" price that moves with happiness and your record. Charging more earns more per fan but brings fewer fans and grumpier ones.</p>
   <p><b>Stadium:</b> six facilities wear down with every home game. Pick an upkeep level for each (STANDARD holds steady, PREMIUM slowly repairs), or pay to upgrade one: it gets a new level and is restored to full condition. Run-down facilities make disasters like burst pipes more likely.</p>
   <p><b>Jerseys:</b> AUTO restocks to match demand. MANUAL lets you push production toward the players you think will sell. Stock for players who leave goes to the clearance rack.</p>
   <p><b>Events:</b> things happen, from sewage leaks and power outages to player arrests and charity requests. You must pick a response before the season continues. Each choice shows its effect, and "risky" ones can backfire.</p>`],
  // ---------- History ----------
  ['hof', 'History & stats', 'Hall of Fame voting', 'hall of fame hof vote ballot induct legends enshrine',
   `<p>After every Megacup you hold the Hall of Fame vote. Press <b>HALL OF FAME VOTE</b> in the header, click any name to review his full career and highlights, and induct up to <b>${HOF_MAX_VOTES}</b> players. Players reach the ballot ${HOF_WAIT} seasons after retiring and stay on it for up to 10 years. The Hall of Fame (History tab) already holds legends from 1967 on.</p>`],
  ['lore', 'History & stats', 'League history since 1967', 'history 1967 lore past champions banners franchise leaders seasons',
   `<p>The league has history back to ${LORE_START}: every season's standings, playoffs and Megacup champion, plus a roster with stats for every team. Open a team, then <b>HISTORY</b> and click any year to see who played and what they did. <b>FRANCHISE LEADERS</b> shows all-time team leaders.</p>`],
  ['banners', 'History & stats', 'Team banners', 'banners titles division conference championship pennant',
   `<p>Every team profile shows its banners: a pennant for each Megacup title and conference title, and its division titles. They update as you win.</p>`],
  ['classes', 'Offseason', 'Draft class strength and settings', 'draft class strength stacked weak deep thin settings position',
   `<p>Draft classes vary: some are <b>stacked</b>, some <b>weak</b>, and individual positions can be <b>deep</b> (more and better prospects) or <b>thin</b>. The class outlook is at the top of the SCOUTING tab.</p>
   <p>Open <b>DRAFT CLASS SETTINGS</b> there to set the overall class and each position to LOW, AVG, HIGH or RANDOM. Settings apply to the next class generated (when a season starts). During week 1, before the first scouting report, you can regenerate the current class too.</p>`],

  ['records', 'History & stats', 'Records and history', 'records record book history hall of fame past seasons',
   `<p>The league starts with a record book and veterans with real career histories. The RECORDS tab tracks single-game, season, career and team records (current-season marks update live). HISTORY has past champions, awards and the Hall of Fame.</p>`],
  ['teamstats', 'History & stats', 'Team stats', 'team stats ranks offense defense points yards leaders compare',
   `<p>Click any team to open its <b>TEAM STATS</b>: per-game offense and defense with league ranks (green = top 8, red = bottom 8) and team leaders. LEADERS → <b>TEAM STATS</b> compares every team in a sortable table.</p>`],
